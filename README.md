The code is a parallel multiphase CFD solver using an algebraic Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method with MTHINC reconstruction for interface capturing. It solves the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with phase change using a one-fluid formulation and an FFT-based pressure solver. A novel feature is the implicit Robin boundary condition for species transport in the liquid phase, coupled with Dirichlet conditions in the gas. The interface velocity is built from a divergence-free liquid extension and a Stefan flow correction, enabling accurate tracking of multicomponent evaporation. Heat transfer, species diffusion, and latent heat effects are fully integrated, and the solver runs efficiently on Cartesian grids using Adams–Bashforth time integration.
